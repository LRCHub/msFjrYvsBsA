Hard road runnin' down, I ain't comin' home too soon, hots on for nowhere, I'm laid out on the cutting room...
I'm just rollin' with the parts I gotta play, where I hit all my marks, and call it a day.

They've been tellin' me, I'm wastin' all my time on you, stuck on the b-side, I can't move 'til you tell me to.

I've been thinkin' 'bout the parts I gotta play, but my head and my heart, get in my way.
